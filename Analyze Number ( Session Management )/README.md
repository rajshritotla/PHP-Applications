# Session Management with PHP

Collect numbers from the users and after they finish indicating all of them, derive all the patterns in the data as you can using PHP.

# Requirements for this exercise

Derive at least these data points:

What is the percentage of even numbers the user indicated?
	
How much delay was there between the user sending in the data? Meaning, if the next POST took 10 seconds from the last post, track 	   those values.

What is the percentage of numbers indicated that were decimal-based, like 1.05 or 100.1?
	
How much data was bad? How many times did the user try to submit bad numbers? (Do not use input type=number in your HTML layer)
	
How long was their session (before then said they were finished with the data inputting)?
