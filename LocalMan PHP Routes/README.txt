LocalMan

Using HTTP request methods, the website will have the following routes:
GET /reviews /* gets all reviews */
GET: /review/[name of place] /* gets just one review */
PUT /review /* creates a new review */
DELETE /review/[name of place] /* delete a review */
PUT /review/name of place /* edits an existing review */
